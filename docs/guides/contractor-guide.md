## How Contractor Access Works

PropManager uses secure token-based access for contractors. This means:

- **No account required** - You don't need to create an account
- **Secure links** - Each work order has a unique, secure access link
- **Limited access** - You can only view work orders assigned to you
- **Time-limited** - Access tokens expire for security

When a property manager assigns you to a work order, you'll receive an email with a secure link to view the details.

## Accessing a Work Order

### Via Email

1. Check your email for a message from the property management company
2. The email will contain:
   - Property and unit information
   - Brief description of the issue
   - A secure link to view full details
3. Click the **View Work Order** link

### What the Link Looks Like

```
https://propmanager.example.com/contractor/work-order/abc123xyz789/
```

The random characters at the end are your unique access token.

### Access Problems

If the link doesn't work:

- **Expired** - Links expire after the work order is completed. Contact the property manager for a new link.
- **Already completed** - The work order may have been marked as completed.
- **Invalid link** - Make sure you're using the complete link from the email.

### How to Update

1. Scroll to the **Status** section

3. Optionally add a note explaining the update
4. Click **Update Status**

### When to Update

- **Acknowledged** - As soon as you review the work order
- **Scheduled** - When you've set an appointment
